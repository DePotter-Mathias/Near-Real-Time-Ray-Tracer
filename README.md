# Near-Real-Time-Ray-Tracer

A multithreaded CPU-only path/ray tracer made with SDL and written in C++.
The project was initially created during my final year in a game development course as a graduate project.

## Getting Started

In the /Release folder you will find an executable build of the project.
Or feel free and get a copy of my project and examine the code.

## Expected performance

The program should run at about ~18-25 fps or ~3-5 fps depending on if Depth of Field is enabled.

## Effects Implemented

* (Diffuse) Reflection
* Opacity
* Refraction
* Depth of field
* Dynamic focal distance
* Soft shadows
* Multiple colored point lights
* Ambient light
* Blinn-Phong shading
* Normal maps and Textures
* Async multithreaded recursive function
* Monte Carlo sampling (for depth of field and soft shadows).

## Possible future changes

* GPU accelerated, as it is now running purly on the cpu.

## Stuff used

* [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) - The development library
* [SDL_TTF](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) - A complementary SDL library for displaying TrueType fonts
* [SDL_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) - A complementary SDL library for reading and writing images
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - IDE of choice
